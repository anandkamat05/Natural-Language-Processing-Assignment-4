The automotive world stopped to listen to what Elon Musk had to say when he announced the new Tesla Roadster. He made some wild claims about the upcoming production model’s performance figures and now these claims are being refuted by some, while others wholeheartedly believe them.Musk said the Roadster will be able to hit sixty in 1.9 seconds and accelerate on to a top speed of over 250 mph. Holding the necessary juice will be a claimed 200 kWh battery pack and the car will apparently be able to carry four people.
The video above posted by Engineering Explained aims to go into more depth regarding Musk’s claims for the future Roadster. The arguments against them are that the quoted sprint time must include rollout in order to drop under 2.05 seconds (due to tire tech limitations), that the battery pack would be really heavy thus blunting cornering and braking among others.
Then, once you have, watch this next video posted above which shows an actual passenger ride in the Roadster at its reveal event. It sprints from naught to nearly 80 mph and the Tesla driver says 60 is dispatched in 1.9 seconds, confirming Musk’s claim while not needing any rollout.
Still, if Tesla could manage, it could effectively invent the world’s first shooting brake hypercar and prove its flagship vehicle is adaptable enough to stick around. While horsepower figures remain in the dark, the Tesla Roadster is supposedly able to summon a 0-60 mph time of 1.9 seconds and a top speed in excess of 250 mph. Like we said, hypercar numbers by sending electric power to all four wheels. Part of the Roadster’s appeal is that Musk is marketing it as a daily-drivable hypercar with room for four and luggage space afforded by the lack of a gasoline engine. X-Tomi’s design, however, encourages our friendly billionaire entrepreneur to go the extra mile on that whole storage space front.
