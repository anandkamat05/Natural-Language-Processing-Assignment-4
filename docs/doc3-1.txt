I’ve had the immense privilege of having interned at Tesla for the last two summers, and in doing so, I was able to witness some pretty remarkable technology. Whether it was the long days prepping my code for the next service release, or watching Elon’s release presentations after work, Tesla has quickly become my favorite company (yes, I’m biased). In an industry dominated by titans with a century of experience, they endure the criticism, hype, and backlash to widen the frontiers of sustainable technology. Last week’s announcement was no different, and while news of the Tesla Semi was spectacular, I want to focus particularly on the 2nd generation Roadster, a new breed of hypercar.
More specifically, we find ourselves at an unprecedented fork in the road of automotive development; many think that the new Roadster represents the pinnacle of achievement in the space. 0-60 in 1.9 seconds, a 250mph+ top speed, and a 620 mile range – what more could you want? A lot, in my opinion, because I’m here to tell you this is just the beginning. Buckle up, because we have begun an industry-wide journey to redefine the boundaries of automotive excellence, and the Roadster is the tip of the iceberg.
