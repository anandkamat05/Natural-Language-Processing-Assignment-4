Though a battery researcher told me he thinks Tesla’s performance claims for its new Roadster are plausible, there are many other factors besides batteries that affect acceleration. So let Jason Fenske from Engineering Explained walk you through the basic physics of how Tesla might pull this off.
Last year, Fenske made a video claiming that the quickest viable zero to 60 mph time given current tire technology is about 2.05 seconds. But in this new video, he says that doesn’t mean Tesla’s 1.9 seconds to 60 mph claim is false, as advances in tire tech could bring the theoretical limit down.
Fenske admits the flaw with his previous zero to 60 mph “theoretical limit” calculation, which was based on a Corvette’s braking distance. The idea, there, was that using a car with the lowest braking distance gives a good indication of the maximum rate of change of a tire’s angular velocity before losing grip.
