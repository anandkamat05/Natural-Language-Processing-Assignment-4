First things first, let’s discuss why electric cars, like the ones Tesla sells as well as the racing variants developed by several automotive giants, are much faster than traditional combustion cars. These cars use electric motors, which provide torque at nearly all RPM levels, including baseline 0. In contrast, combustion engines have low torque at the beginning of their start cycle, and build up towards with every gear shift. This is why normal cars start in a low gear, and rapidly shift upwards – they are matching the torque output to the speed of the car. Moreover, electric cars have no gears, low centers of gravity, and batteries that output power far more efficiently than gas to a loaded piston. The cumulative result, juxtaposed with the fact that there is much less energy dissipated as heat, is a revolutionary technology that invariably supersedes its inferior little brother.
It’s the latter point I want to hammer home; internal combustion engines are becoming truly substandard. As we push for the bigger and the better for the future of road cars, automotive manufacturers realize that we are at the periphery of an automotive arms race, one that won’t formally end until every car company has a 1000hp, 250mph, 500+ mile, zero-emission beast under their belts. People are talking more about the Roadster than they are the Tesla Semi, which was the initial purpose of the unveiling event. Hypercars are big money, and every titan in the space has an R&D or design shop working tirelessly to unveil something soon. In fact, this isn’t even speculative; the Rimac Concept One fully embarrassed the LaFerrari in a drag race, and NextEV’s supercar rendition just set a new production car record, lapping the Nordschleife in just 6:45. As I’ve mentioned before, the EV winter is coming.
