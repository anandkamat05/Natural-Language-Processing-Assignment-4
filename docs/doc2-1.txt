The new Tesla Roadster was an unqualified hit at the Tesla Semi event but that hasn't dispelled doubts about the Model 3 and the just-revealed truck.
This covers the week ending Friday November 17 and the holiday week ending Friday November 24. There was no shortage of videos about the roadster (e.g., here and here) that popped out of a Tesla Semi at the November 16 event. But the Roadster test drive replete with the 0-60 acceleration experience was one of the best (below). But note that this is not a production Roadster so the 0-60/1.9 sec. cannot be independently verified, as pointed out in this video.
Other questions include:  How a small Roadster would squeeze a 200 kWh battery (twice as large as the largest battery available in an EV) into its small frame? These claims are so far beyond current industry standards for electric vehicles that they would require either advances in battery technology or a new understanding of how batteries are put to use, said Sam Jaffe, battery analyst for Cairn Energy Research in Boulder, Colorado. In some cases, experts suspect Tesla might be banking on technological improvements between now and the time when new vehicles are actually ready for delivery
