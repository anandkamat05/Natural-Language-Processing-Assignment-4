Elon Musk is no stranger to making bombastic claims. This is the same man who once said that autonomous driving technology was at our fingertips. He is also the same man who said that civilian space travel is possible and traveling at supersonic speeds inside a pressure sealed tube is the future of public transportation. Do not look now, but Musk is at it again with a new proclamation that has everyone in the auto industry buzzing. According to him, the new Tesla Roadster, which is scheduled to debut in 2020, is capable of sprinting from 0 to 60 mph in 1.9 seconds, becoming the first production car in history to reach that mark in less than two seconds.
I will be the first to say that I do not know enough about physics to properly answer that question. It is only right then that I direct the question to Jason Fenske from Engineering Explained, a man who is far more qualified to talk about Musk’s latest claims about the Roadster’s acceleration speed.Fenske didn’t exactly have the answer either, but that was more because of the lack of information from Tesla’s side. What he did explain was that it’s possible for the Roadster to do a 1.9-second, 0-to-60-mph, provided that it’s done under the right confluence of technology, all working together in perfect harmony. Fenske alludes to a number of important elements the Roadster needs to have to be able to live up to Musk’s claims, including the electric motor, the traction system, and most importantly, the tires.
