The Tesla Roadster could easily become the first shooting brake hypercar. Upon surprising the world by sending a red Roadster out of the rear end of a new Tesla Semi, Elon Musk grinned at the audience and explained why his company decided to build it. He said that the reason behind its mind-bending performance figures was to give “a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars.” The audience loved it, and so did we for that matter, but we couldn’t help but wonder what it would look like if that hardcore smackdown came in more forms than one.
If we humans have learned one thing on through our rise to the top of the food chain, its that the fastest and strongest species isn’t always the one that makes it to the top. It’s the most adaptable one that survives life’s bottlenecking events and is allowed to conquer the world. 
That’s why one of our favorite rendering artists, X-Tomi Design, thought it would be cool to nab photos of the Tesla Roadster and touch them up using imaging software and years of experience to give us this, the Tesla Roadster Shooting Brake. Not going to lie, it’s a bit far-fetched to expect Tesla to build one of these. At the moment the young automaker can’t even get an affordable sedan out to the masses, so a Ferrari GTC4Lusso fighter might be too much to expect.
